# Canary advanced

A canary deployment is really useful in the case of web servers, as the load can get balanced on new nodes and you can check if the new pod takes well to the load compared to the old pods. If we have control over the Ingress, we can shape the traffic sent to those canary pods to better suit them to the upgrade (e.g. send less traffic for new pods, or ensure that a client using the canary pods will not alternate between the canary and the stable release.).

First, we'll create a Rollout, two Services and one Ingress.  The services at creation should be identical except for the name - Argo will modify them to add a selector depending on the stable and canary releases.

You can inspect the manifests in the folder `03.canary-advanced`.
Apply them with `kubectl apply -f /assets/03.canary-advanced/`{{execute HOST1}}.

You should now be able to access the application with the links on the top page "Stable release" and "Preview release".
"Stable release" will point on the "stable" application, that will be served to your clients, in this case a mix between the current and old release. the preview will point exclusively on the latest release, in this case the one being installed.

Now, let's force a change in this deployment : 
`kubectl patch Rollout example-rollout --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image", "value":"kalioz/canary-deployment-ui:v1.1.0-yang"}]'`{{execute HOST1}}

You should be able to see the evolution of the deployment on the application deployed and on the Argo Dashboard.
