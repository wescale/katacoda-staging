# Blue/Green Deployment

A blue/green deployment is useful when you need to be able to quickly switch between the current and the next version of the deployment, while keeping an option to do the reverse switch easily. It also enables you to test the next version on the production servers while keeping your clients on the stable version.

Kubernetes doesn't have any out-of-the-box deployment that would match a true blue-green deployment, so to use this feature you'll always need to use a CRD (or to manually develop it !).

To deploy a Rollout with the Blue/Green type, you need to use the following manifest : 

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: bluegreen-app
spec:
  strategy:
    blueGreen:
      # service for the "stable" application
      activeService: bluegreen-1-active
      # service for the "preview" application - outside of deployments, it will point on activeService
      previewService: bluegreen-1-preview
      # keep promotion manual for now
      autoPromotionEnabled: false
      # keep the old application 5m after having done the promotion - this is useful in case you need to rollback quickly.
      scaleDownDelaySeconds: 300
      
      #... and also :
      # reduce the number of replicas the preview service uses - it will be scaled once it is promoted
      previewReplicaCount: 2
      # run some tests before the promotion. It can be used to run the promotion automatically
      prePromotionAnalysis: null
      # run some tests after the promotion. It can be used to rollback the promotion if something went wrong.
      postPromotionAnalysis: null
  ...
```

We created a manifest ready to deploy on the path `/assets/04.blue-green/`; apply it with the command `kubectl apply -f /assets/04.blue-green/`{{execute}}.

You should now see the newly deployed app on the dashboard, and both `stable` and `preview` links on top of the console should point to the application.

Edit now the Rollout to change the image name : `kubectl patch Rollout blue-green --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image", "value":"kalioz/canary-deployment-ui:v1.1.0-yang"}]'`{{execute HOST1}}

You should see on the dashboard the new pods being created; the `stable` link should still point to the `ying` application, while the `preview` link should point to the `yang` application.

On the dashboard, click on the "promote" button to finalize the deployment. you should now see that both the `stable` and the `preview` link point to the `yang` application.
