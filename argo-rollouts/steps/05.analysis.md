# Analysis

For now, we've seen how to use canary and blue-green deployments manually. The functionnality is neat, but if we want to ensure a good deployment it should be automatised, with tests along the way to prevent any error going to the production server.

That's where the AnalysisTemplate CRD comes to light : It allows you to create tests that can be performed before, during or after a deployment. With the Experiment CRD, those tests can also live totally outside of the scope of a Rollout, more on that later.

Analysis can do multiple things : they can query a prometheus / cloudwatch / datadog to check if the error rate is steady, execute http requests to ensure a server is functionning, or even run a dedicated job leaving you a total customisation possible.

Here is an example of an AnalysisTemplate, which uses the `linkchecker` image to check if the URL has any dead links :

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AnalysisTemplate
metadata:
  name: linkchecker
spec:
  # here we define the arguments that will be passed to the analysis
  args:
  - name: fqdn

  # here we define the metrics the analysis will use to determine if the run should be succesful.
  metrics:
    # checks that the server is responsive on the provided fqdn
    - name: webmetric
      successCondition: result == 'true'
      provider:
      web:
        url: "{{ args.fqdn }}/index.html"
        jsonPath: "{$.results.ok}"
    # checks that there are no broken links in the server
    - name: check-broken-links
      provider:
        job:
          spec:
            backoffLimit: 1
            template:
              spec:
                containers:
                - name: linkchecker
                  image: linkchecker/linkchecker
                  args: ["--verbose", "--check-extern", "{{ args.fqdn }}"]
                restartPolicy: Never
```
