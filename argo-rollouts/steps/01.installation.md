Please wait while we're installing the following components : 
- Nginx Ingress Controller
- Argo Rollouts Dashboard<br/>

Katacoda can take some time to set up, please be patient :)

> If, once the installation is over, the "Dashboard" page doesn't load after multiple tries, you should try restarting the scenario - this is due to some quirks in the Katacoda API. 

# First things first - Let's install Argo

## Argo Rollout CRD

For starters, we'll install Argo Rollouts from the official repos into its namespace `argo-rollouts`:

`kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml`{{execute HOST1}}

This will create all that is necessary for Argo Rollouts (CRDs, Service Accounts, controllers...). Note that Argo Rollouts is separate from the other Argo solutions (CD, Workflows) - it can be used with those, but it can also be used with other solutions.

> a CRD is a way to define another object in Kubernetes - in this case, the object `Rollout` will be created and should be used to do deployments instead of `Deployment`.


## Argo Rollout CLI 

We'll also install the Kubernetes CLI plugin, which allows you to have a better view onto your deployments than just using the kubectl utility.


```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/kubectl-argo-rollouts-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kubectl-argo-rollouts-linux-amd64
sudo mv ./kubectl-argo-rollouts-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kubectl-argo-rollouts
```{{execute HOST1}}

You can confirm the good installation of your plugin with this command : 
`kubectl argo rollouts version`{{execute HOST1}}

# A graphical interface, to better follow the deployments

In order to better follow the deployments we already installed the argo-rollouts dashboard on the environment. You can access it with the `Dashboard` link.

This dashboard will enable you to see the Rollouts, their current state and possibly do some action on them (promote, rollback, etc).
These action call all be done with the CLI.

# Notes on networking

If you're interested on how we set up the networking for this Katacoda, take a peek at this folder : `/assets/00.global-components`.

We've defined 2 services/ingress related to Argo Rollouts : 
- "stable": targets both the "old" and the "new" application, depending on the rollout type and its progression. this is the service your users will use.
- "preview": targets the "new" version of the application.
