# Analysis and Rollout

We'll now see how to integrate our analysis in a canary Rollout.

To use it, you'll need to add a step "analysis" to your canary rollout ; note that you can also run an analysis during the entirety of your rollout if you have the use for it (for example to monitor the error rate on prometheus).

Here is the updated code of our canary Rollout :

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: canary-with-analysis
spec:
  strategy:
    canary: #Indicates that the rollout should use the Canary strategy
      stableService: rollouts-demo-stable
      canaryService: rollouts-demo-preview
      steps:
      - setWeight: 25
      - pause:
          duration: 10s
      - setWeight: 75
      - analysis:
          templates:
          - templateName: linkchecker
          args:
          - name: fqdn
            value: http://rollouts-demo-preview.default.svc.cluster.local:8080
      - pause:
          duration: 30s
      - setWeight: 100 # the analysis needs to success to complete the deployment.
```

Deploy the code with the command `kubectl apply -f /assets/06.analysis-canary/`{{execute}}.

Edit the deployment to use another image : `kubectl patch Rollout canary-with-analysis --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image", "value":"kalioz/webserver:ko"}]'`{{execute HOST1}}.

You should see in the dashboard the execution of the deployment, with the linkchecker Analysis being run before validating (or not !) the deployment. The image given should not pass the Analysis, and therefore the deployment will be reverted.

You can also see the evolution using the cli : `kubectl argo rollouts get rollout canary-with-analysis -w`{{execute}}. use `ctrl + c` to quit the cli.

Re-edit the deployment to use a working image : `kubectl patch Rollout canary-with-analysis --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image", "value":"kalioz/canary-deployment-ui:v1.1.0-yang"}]'`{{execute HOST1}}.

You should now see that the deployment goes to 100% without problems.
