# Canary deployment

We'll first see the canary deployment functionnality of Argo Rollouts. It is the closest match to Kubernetes rolling-update deployment, but adds more checks to allow / deny the upgrade to continue :
- ability to pause between different steps (for a certain duration or wait for manual input)
- direct a certain percentage of traffic to the canary pod
- Analysis as a step / in the background / after a deployment - an Analysis is a set of tests that will be run on the canary replicas.
- Experiment

To use a canary deployment, you need to use the following structure :

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: canary
spec:
  template:
    # PodTemplate here, as you would for a Deployment
  strategy:
    canary: #Indicates that the rollout should use the Canary strategy
      canaryService: rollouts-demo-preview
      maxSurge: "25%"
      maxUnavailable: 0
      steps:
      - setWeight: 25
      - pause:
          duration: 30s
      - setWeight: 75
      - pause: {} # pause indefinitly - wait for manual input.
```

To test it, use the command `kubectl apply -f /assets/02.canary/`{{execute T1}}.

The first version will be deployed directly. If you refresh the argo-rollouts dashboard by clicking on the argo icon, you should see the Rollout appear. From this UI you can manipulate Rollouts, meaning you can allow / cancel an upgrade, force a rollback, etc.

You can also use the CLI to check the deployment : 
`kubectl argo rollouts get rollout canary -w`{{execute T2}}

We'll now try modifying the Rollout by changing its base image :

`kubectl patch Rollout canary --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image", "value":"kalioz/canary-deployment-ui:v1.1.0-yang"}]'`{{execute T1}}

You should now see in the UI the rollout following the multiple steps : first deploy 25% of the new pods, then wait for 30s, then deploy 75% of the new pods, and wait indefinitly for a manual input. You can press the "promote" button once you want the deployment to continue. Note that a "full" promotion means skipping all the steps to get to the next version.

You can also do a promotion with the cli, using the following command : `kubectl argo rollouts promote canary`{{execute T1}}
