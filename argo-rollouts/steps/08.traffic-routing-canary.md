# Canary deployments and traffic routing

Now that we've seen how to do automated tests on canary deployments, you might ask : isn't it risky to deploy a preview pod accessible on the stable service if there is a chance the tests do not pass ? the answer is yes !

Argo Rollouts enables you to fine-grain the deployment of your canary pod AND of the traffic that is given to these pods; by default the traffic is egal to the percentage of pods you deploy, but it can be modified to be less or more.

To do so, you'll need control over your ingress, and to modify your canary deployment to add the `setCanaryScale` and `matchTrafficWeight` steps. As per the doc, be careful using these options as a wrong configuration could end up sending 90% of the traffic to 10% of the available pods (canary).

```yaml
spec:
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
      # explicit count
      - setCanaryScale:
          replicas: 3
      # a percentage of spec.replicas
      - setCanaryScale:
          weight: 25
      # send 10% of the traffic to the deployed pods - note that since we used setCanaryScale, this does NOT modify the number of pods.
      - setWeight: 10
      # matchTrafficWeight returns to the default behavior of matching the canary traffic weight
      - setCanaryScale:
          matchTrafficWeight: true
```

So, to use with our analysis, a prime example would be : 

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: canary-with-analysis
spec:
  replicas: 5
  strategy:
    canary: #Indicates that the rollout should use the Canary strategy
      trafficRouting:
        nginx:
          stableIngress: rollouts-demo
      # set the service pointing to the stable release.
      stableService: rollouts-demo-stable
      # set the service pointing to the preview release
      canaryService: rollouts-demo-preview
      steps:
      - setCanaryScale:
          replicas: 1
      # note that 1 canary pod is deployed, and 0% of the traffic will go to it for now
      # run the analysis on that pod
      - analysis:
          templates:
          - templateName: linkchecker
          args:
          - name: fqdn
            value: http://rollouts-demo-preview.default.svc.cluster.local:8080
      - pause:
          duration: 30s
      # if the analysis succeed, gradually increase the weight of the deployment
      - setCanaryScale:
          # don't forget to restore the pods<->traffic link
          matchTrafficWeight: true
      - setWeight: 50
      - setWeight: 100
```

Apply the code : `kubectl apply -f /assets/08.traffic-routing-canary/`{{execute}}.
Open the `stable` link.

Now edit the Rollout to start a new deployment : `kubectl patch Rollout canary-with-analysis --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image", "value":"kalioz/canary-deployment-ui:v1.1.0-yang"}]'`{{execute HOST1}}.

You should see on the `stable` link that even though the pod has been created and the tests is run on it, no stable traffic is directed to it until at least 30s.
