# Argo Rollouts

Welcome to this course on Argo Rollouts !

Argo rollout is a kubernetes controller and set of CRDs which provide advanced deployment capabilities such as blue-green, canary, canary analysis and experimentation to Kubernetes.

## The default deployment on Kubernetes

Kubernetes includes by default two ways of doing a deployment upgrade : rolling-update and recreate. This is enough for most of the users who will validate manually the deployment, but when you want to deploy in a fast-paced environment or in an environment that doesn't tolerate downtime, you need to consider external tools that will bring additional options; Hence argo rollouts.
