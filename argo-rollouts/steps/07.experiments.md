# Experiments

Experiments allow users to have ephemeral runs of one or more replicaset, and to run multiple Analysis on those replicaset.

They can be used to test an application in a CI, to test multiple version of a same application against the same Analysis or to run during a Rollout to check if the stable and the preview version behave correctly.

The spec of an Experiment contains both the definition of the replicasets and a link to existings Analysis : 

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Experiment
metadata:
  name: example-experiment
spec:
  # Duration of the experiment, beginning from when all ReplicaSets became healthy (optional)
  # If omitted, will run indefinitely until terminated, or until all analyses which were marked
  # `requiredForCompletion` have completed.
  duration: 20m

  # Deadline in seconds in which a ReplicaSet should make progress towards becoming available.
  # If exceeded, the Experiment will fail.
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 30

  # List of pod template specs to run in the experiment as ReplicaSets
  templates:
  - name: purple
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: canary-demo
        color: purple
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: canary-demo
          color: purple
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: rollouts-demo
          image: argoproj/rollouts-demo:purple

  # List of AnalysisTemplate references to perform during the experiment
  analyses:
  - name: orange
    templateName: http-benchmark
    # If requiredForCompletion is true for an analysis reference, the Experiment will not complete
    # until this analysis has completed.
    requiredForCompletion: true
    args:
    - name: host
      value: purple
```

Deploy the official experiment with `kubectl apply -f /assets/07.experiments/`{{execute}}.
You can see its evolution with the command `kubectl argo rollouts get experiment experiment-demo -w`{{execute T2}}.
