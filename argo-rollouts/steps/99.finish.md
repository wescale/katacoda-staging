# Conclusion

You've now seen how argo-rollouts works, and enables you to use blue-green and canary deployments.
What makes the strength of this plugin is not the new deployments but the automated tests framework that goes with it, enabling you to deploy your applications with more serenity.

The CRD can be used outside of the other Argo frameworks (workflow, CD, etc...) - for example, it is compatible with fluxcd.
